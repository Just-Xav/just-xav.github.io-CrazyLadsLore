        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>SCP- 7892 uses the mystical powers of the angel and demon to keep the balance between SCP-1763 and SCP-1763-a. The egg may look like a little ray of sunshine but it should not be treated like one, the whimsical demon egg battles an addiction with meth and cocaine to help with the evil thoughts. SCP-7892 was first found in 1376bc and has been transported all over the spice islands, such as the UK, New zeland, phlliop islands and Austria before being detained in the 2000s by its true master "the decaying egg".</p>
